# Summary

A flexible framework for creating data-driven models of phenomena for which there is no benchmark.

# Statement of need

`ADaPT-ML` is a Python package that ties together the `Label Studio` package [@LabelStudio],
`Snorkel` [@Snorkel], and a variety of supervised learning algorithms
to take the development work out of creating novel models from novel ideas, supporting
the progress of interdisciplinary work in testing theories of social communication on
big data.
